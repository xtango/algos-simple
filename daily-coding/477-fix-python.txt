/**
 *                  Problem #477 [Easy] - FIX PYTHON lambda
 * 
 * This problem was asked by Dropbox.
 * What does the below code snippet print out? How can we fix the anonymous functions to behave as we'd expect?
 *
 * functions = []
 * for i in range(10):
 *     functions.append(lambda : i)
 * 
 * for f in functions:
 *     print(f())
 */

/**
 * It prints 9 9 ... 9 ten times for this reason: i remains 9 after the 1st for loop.
 * Assuming the goal is to print 0..0, we can change the code to this:
 
functions = []
for i in range(10):
    functions.append(lambda : i)

i = 0 // Fix
for f in functions:
    print(f())
    i = i + 1 // Fix
