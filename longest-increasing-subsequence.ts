/**
 * LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE IN ARRAY
 * 
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or
 * no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 *
 * Methodology
 * Approach 1: O(n^2)   Uses memoization to record the longest sub-seq to the left of i that's smaller than seq[i]. 
 * Approach 2: O(log N) Uses a PATIENCE SORT https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience_sorting

/**
* Patience sort
*
* The algorithm's name derives from a simplified variant of the patience card game. 
* The game begins with a shuffled deck of cards. The cards are dealt one by one into
* a sequence of piles on the table, according to the following rules.
* 
* Initially, there are no piles. The first card dealt forms a new pile consisting of 
* the single card. Each subsequent card is placed on the leftmost existing pile whose 
* top card has a value greater than or equal to the new card's value, or to the right 
* of all of the existing piles, thus forming a new pile. When there are no more cards
* remaining to deal, the game ends.
*
* This card game is turned into a two-phase sorting algorithm, as follows. Given an 
* array of n elements from some totally ordered domain, consider this array as a 
* collection of cards and simulate the patience sorting game. When the game is over,
* recover the sorted sequence by repeatedly picking off the minimum visible card;
* in other words, perform a k-way merge of the p piles, each of which is internally sorted.
*
