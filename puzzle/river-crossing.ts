 * From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf,_goat_and_cabbage_problem
 * 
 * "Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage.
 * On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat.
 * But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one
 * of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.
 * If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.
 * The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river,
 * leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?"
